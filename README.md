# fragmented-regex

Maintainable regex, Shareable regex, Extended regex and Splendid regex. Power regex with the best bits of ES6 and the parser combinator.

## Motivation

Dealing with string was a wordy job. For example, CSS and RegExp, they were derived from business needs, suffered from rapid change and will eventually grow into an unrefactorable enormous string.

Now there are [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for CSS, which allow [styled-flex-component](https://github.com/SaraVieira/styled-flex-component) and [rebass](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass) to emerge. So CSS can be npm-publishable strings that are business-independent.

And I really need a similar thing for RegExp.
